                        Much of the literature relating to public space and young people, groups young people together as one single sub-section of the wider population. Within this category, however, there are a number of sub-populations, each presenting a number of unique issues in their use of public space. When interacting with public space, a disabled young person, for example, will have needs quite different to those of a homeless young person.
In this section you will find a range of resources exploring the issues, policies, and projects relevant to particular sub-groups of young people and their use of public space.
