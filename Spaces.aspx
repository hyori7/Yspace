                        Young people are substantial users of public space; footpaths, shopping centres,
                        parks and libraries play an integral role in the day-to-day lives of young people.
                        This reliance on public space is largely due to the lifestyle of young people; they
                        are heavily reliant on public transport and cannot access many private venues due
                        to age and/or monetary restrictions. The ways in which young people interact with
                        public space has been the cause of both national and international debate about
                        young people’s rights, responsibilities, and their place within contemporary society.
                        Each type of public space presents unique challenges and opportunities for young
                        people and those who manage the space. A library, for example, has a greater capacity
                        to become a youth-inclusive space than a streetscape. In this section you will find
                        a number of resources that examine contemporary issues, policies and projects relevant
                        to youth and public space.
