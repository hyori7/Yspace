                        Given the many different types of public space and the variety of uses associated with each space, there is no one strategy that best manages public space.
Currently, there are two broad strategies employed to manage public spaces:<br /><br />
•	Exclusionary strategies, which include curfews, police move-on powers and surveillance;<br />
•	Inclusive strategies, such as facility provision for young people, designing more inclusive spaces and safety promotion.<br /><br />
To date, research indicates that there are important connections between social policy, urban planning processes, and the design and management of spaces. These connections can be utilised to create a more multi-dimensional approach to public space strategies and management than ever before.
In this section you will find a number of links and resources covering a diverse array of topics and debates related to public space management.
