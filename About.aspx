                    <p>
                        Yspace was born out of recognition that few mechanisms exist to respond to the 
                        critical issue of how young people&#39;s needs can be better reflected in the design 
                        and management of public and community accessed space. <br />
                        Yspace seeks to provide a space for researchers, young people, various levels of 
                        government, planners, and youth services to access information, insights and 
                        resources pertaining to youth and public space. In doing so, Yspace strives to 
                        promote the development of youth inclusive policy in the design and management 
                        of public spaces.
