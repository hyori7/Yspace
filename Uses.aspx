                        Young people use public space for <asp:Image ID="Image1" 
                            runat="server" ImageAlign="Right" ImageUrl="~/images/rollerblader.jpg" 
                            Width="200px" />
                        transport, recreational, commercial, social and cultural purposes. Many of these 
                        uses lay at the centre of a great deal of public discussion and debate. 
                        Graffiti, for example, has generated a lot of public debate regarding the 
                        management of spaces and the rights and responsibilities of young people. The 
                        manner in which young people use a space is influenced by a number of factors 
                        including; popular culture, design of the space, location, facilities, 
                        interactivity and the management of the space. In this section you will find a 
                        number of resources that explore the various ways young people navigate public 
                        space and the different ideas and debates associated with each use.
